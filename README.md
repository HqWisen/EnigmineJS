# EnigmineJS (Enigma I Simulator)

Enigma is an electro-mechanical cryptographic machine that is able to encrypt and decrypt messages. Various versions of this machine were used in the middle of the 20th century.

The goal of this work was to create a web application using javascript (with use of html and css). The web application provides a visual and functional simulations of Enigma I machine.

This program was developed by Hakim Boulahya during his third year of BA in Computer Sciences. You can download the javascript source code and his report (in French). You can also try this simulator on [Hakim's web-page](http://student.ulb.ac.be/~hboulahy/enigma/).

The project was supervised by Nikita Veshchikov.

The director of the project is Olivier Markowitch.
